# Coolant! - LD50

![screenshot3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iambaangkok/LudumDare50/master/itchassets/screenshot3.PNG)

The Reactor is heating up and it will explode!! ... unless you cool it down with something ... maybe a Coolant!

**Coolants** are dropped around the map and you must take them to the **Reactor**.

But that is not so easy because when the Coolant spawns, some **inter-dimensional lava slimes** also spawns. They want the coolant to cool their melting body!
