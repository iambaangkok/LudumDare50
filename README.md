# Coolant! - LD50

The Reactor is heating up and it will explode!! ... unless you cool it down with something ... maybe a Coolant!

**Coolants** are dropped around the map and you must take them to the **Reactor**.

But that is not so easy because when the Coolant spawns, some inter-dimensional lava slimes also spawns. They want the coolant to cool their melting body!
